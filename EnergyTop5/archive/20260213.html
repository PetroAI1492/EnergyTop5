        <div class="narrative">
          The easing of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela marks a significant shift in the geopolitical landscape, enabling major oil companies to re-enter a market long restricted due to political tensions. This move could not only stabilize Venezuela's fractured economy but also alter energy supply dynamics in a region heavily influenced by U.S.-China rivalry. Energy-sector executives should recognize the potential for increased investment opportunities, while also preparing for the complexities of engaging in a recovering market that may come with regulatory and operational challenges.
