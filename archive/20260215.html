          <strong>Why This Matters Now:</strong> This article matters now for energy-sector executives as it highlights geopolitical developments that could significantly impact global oil supply and prices amidst ongoing tensions with Iran.
        </div>

        <div class="narrative">
          The agreement between Trump and Netanyahu to intensify pressure on Iranian oil signifies a strategic shift in regional energy dynamics, particularly in light of Iran's influence over global oil markets. By targeting Iranian oil, the U.S. and Israel aim to curb Tehran's economic stability and its ability to fund regional activities that threaten both nations' interests. Energy-sector executives should recognize the potential volatility in oil prices and supply chains that may arise from this geopolitical maneuvering, and consider the implications for their market strategies and risk management approaches in a highly interconnected global energy landscape.
