          The agreement between Trump and Netanyahu to increase pressure on Iranian oil sales to China is significant as it reflects a strategic effort to undermine Iran's economic stability, which could lead to broader geopolitical ramifications in the Middle East and beyond. This move is likely to impact global oil markets, influencing supply chains and potentially elevating tensions between the U.S. and China in their economic rivalry. Energy sector executives should consider the implications of fluctuating oil prices and potential shifts in supply as the geopolitical landscape evolves, and re-evaluate their strategies for navigating risks associated with Middle Eastern oil dependency.
