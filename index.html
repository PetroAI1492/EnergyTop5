            <div class="body">
                Hungary's continued purchase of Russian oil is not only supporting the Kremlin's military efforts but also financially benefiting foundations associated with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. This reliance on Russian energy raises ethical concerns and highlights the complex interplay between national interests and geopolitical dynamics in the region.
